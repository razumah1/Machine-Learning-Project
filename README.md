# Machine-Learning-Project

Project Overview:
-----------------
This repository contains the code implementation for a machine learning project that explores semi-supervised learning techniques using the MNIST digits dataset and a custom Two-Moon toy dataset. The project involves training neural networks with various architectures and employing techniques such as Entropy Minimization, Pseudo Labeling, and Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT).

Getting Started:
----------------

1. Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using:


2. Execute the Code:
- Navigate to the 'code' directory:
  ```
  cd code
  ```

- Run the main script for the MNIST dataset:
  ```
  python mnist_experiment.py
  ```

- Run the main script for the Two-Moon dataset:
  ```
  python two_moon_experiment.py
  ```

Note: Adjust the hyperparameters, dataset configurations, and experiment settings directly in the respective script files.

Results and Analysis:
---------------------
1. The results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will be displayed in the console for each experiment.

2. Figures illustrating the training error for each method and dataset will be saved in the 'figures' directory.

3. Tables summarizing the accuracy of the models for different experiments will be saved in the 'tables' directory.

4. Adjust the plotting configurations and output paths in the scripts if needed.

Conclusion:
------------
This project provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning techniques. Feel free to explore and modify the code to further experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and datasets.
